### About my Lottery project

Lottery is simple gaming page in which the visitor can play it. the rules are so easy and the visitor can find out it when visit the web.

I developed it using HTML, CSS, Javascript. 

I am going to change its one nuance about jackpot, as you can see when we refresh the page Jackpot is also refreshed, so that in the future I want to use local storage, so that Jackpot will enhance, until someone win it.
